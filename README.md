# Keystone Images
Discussion and Docs on approach for image picker for Keystone TinyMCE Rich Text Editor.

## Structure
There are two main parts:

1. Editor inclusion (RTE)
2. Field for managing any files & images long-term. 

In the Editor, there will be insertion & uploading of Images and of Files.

For the managing of files, we need to be able to see what files are uploaded and optionally allow further uploads here.
